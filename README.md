# AVA dataset download tools in Python

## Overview

Some scripts written in Python I used to download the [Google AVA dataset](https://research.google.com/ava/index.html).

Downloaded videos are hosted by the [Commong Visual Data Foundation](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/ava-dataset).

Not the cleanest of codde but I hope it might help sand save you some time :)

## Getting started

Clone it anywhere you like and import everything. 

 - download.py has some (very long named) utility function to download the datasets, labels an file list (start with those two if you don't have them yet)
 - process.py will have some functions you might need to cut the videos to your liking so as to not bloat your disk with 150+ Go of random movies
